	<div class="subtitle"><h1>Name one advantage to using GitHub and one advantage to using the cPanel hosting.</h1></div>
	<div class="subtitle1"><h2>An advantage to using GitHub is the ability of viewing code online in a website's repository. On the other hand, an advantage to using cPanel hosting is the ability to view file management in a user-friendly environment. Additionally, cPanel hosting automates much of the processes involved in web hosting for a customer.</h2>
	<div class="subtitle"><h1>Which of the types of hosting do you prefer and why?</h1></div>
	<div class="subtitle1"><h2>My preferred type of web hosting is GitHub. This is because, with GitHub, developers can view code in a website's online repository. Additionally, it allows for collaboration between developers when contributing to the development of a website.</h2>
	<div class="subtitle"><h1>What was the most satisfying part of this assignment?</h1></div>
	<div class="subtitle2"><h2>The most satisfying part of this assignment is the element of creative control. As an experienced web developer, using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to design different components of a website is satisfying in respect to making a website appear visually appealing from scratch.</h2>
